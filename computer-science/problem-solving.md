# ðŸ¤” Problem Solving

To fully be able to problem solve you need the context of the domain you are in.

## Programming Questions

The most common reason to fully learn the domain of data structures and algorithms is for application to programming questions.

### How to approach a programming question

1. Speak aloud the question to yourself / the interviewer
2. Ask for any information that is missing or any form of clarification needed
3. Logically think of a human understable solution (How would you solve it - Not in code!)
4. After explaining the human approach to solving it write it down in steps
5. After you wrote down the steps in order of what you would do first to last translate each step to code
6. If the approach is wrong re do the steps above
7. Throughout the process speak aloud your thoughts
8. Once you have a solution in code, offer the time and space complexity.&#x20;
9. Think of alternative solutions, data structures, algorithms you could have used and say them.
