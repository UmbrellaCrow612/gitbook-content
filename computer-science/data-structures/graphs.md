# Graphs

## What is a graph

A Graph is an abstract data type, meaning its underlying implementation can change based on what programming language you use, however it follows a set of rules that are consistent through most programming languages.

This is a key idea to understand, as once you understand the fundamentals of what a Graph  is, what operations it typically supports and when its used, are you able to implement it and use it effectively.

### Definition of a graph

Set of nodes connected by edges, a node is a specific data type that can hold references to other nodes its connected to.

### Properties of a graph

* Contains nodes
* Nodes can references other nodes its connected to
* Follow a specific graph shape or none

### Operations of a graph

* Search the graph - time complexity varies on the graph type
* Add items to the graph - time complexity varies on the graph type
* Remove items from the graph - time complexity varies on the graph type
* Restructure the graph - time complexity varies on the graph type

## Visual flow of operations

Here there will be a visual representation of what happens in most common operations for a graph.

### Adding an item to a graph

It really depends on what type of graph your dealing with but here is a common scenerio

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Step 1" %}

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 2" %}
<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (58).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 3" %}
<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (59).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Step 4" %}
<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (60).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
