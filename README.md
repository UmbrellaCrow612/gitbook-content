# What is programming

## Introduction

You might have an idea of what programming is already, or don't,  because you might have seen a video, article or someone tell you something about it. But programming in the simplest form is making a computer do what you want it to do, to make videos, websites, scripts, applications anything that you see or don't see on a computer. That's what software engineering is, the engineering of a computer to achieve what you want.

### Misconceptions&#x20;

When people first start they look at tutorials or youtube videos telling them this or that,  about do x to land a job or do y to get another job. But when you first start programming ignore those and focus on the fundamental building blocks of what programming is and then choose a discipline to go in. Remember Front End development is not everything because most videos get you to build these stuff and it provides a false sense of security, when you don't really know what's going on.

### What todo

* Learn the [fundamentals of programming](programming/fundamental-concepts.md)
* Understand that you don't need to know everything
* Understand that you should not focus learning the bleeding edge tech that most videos show you
* Understand that most big companies use so called old tech
* Understand that learning and becoming good in these so called old tech lands you a job
* Understand that you should pick a discipline and focus on becoming a master in it (specific field in software engineering)
* Always keep learning and becoming better
* Enjoy learning and becoming better&#x20;
